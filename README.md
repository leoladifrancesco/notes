- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan your time wisely, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your work. First, determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. Then, break down each task into smaller, manageable steps. By doing this, you can focus on one task at a time without becoming overwhelmed.
